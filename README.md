This is an experiment in creating a hybrid native/web-app for Twitter using data from the PWA ([Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction)) manifest.

```bash
$ make
$ ./run
```

Features:
- Desktop entry shortcuts (the icons don't look good this small)
- Saved session data

TODO:
- Notifications (if possible)
- Native dialogs
- Fix context menu
